A simple chatbot I wrote while forced to quarantine for two weeks.

Based on the early chatbot Eliza, this chatbot is simple and only answers questions with more questions. It matches words to itself by finding wildcards in the matchRule function. 

Once the matchRule function is complete with finding the correct answer template and choosing the wildcards to put inside, the answer is built using lambda functions to craft a response based on the user's input.

This was my first big Python project, and my first non-graphic project in a very long time. Indentation issues were the bane of my existence as I wrote this program.
